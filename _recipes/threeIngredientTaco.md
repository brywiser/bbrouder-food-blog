This recipe rocks for a super easy chicken taco meat that can be used in Tacos, Salads, or even by itself if desired.  Feel free to add some onion to it, but I personally think it is great as is!  

It's dead simple, just add all the ingredients to a slow and mix them together, then let it cook, very simple and just three ingredients.
