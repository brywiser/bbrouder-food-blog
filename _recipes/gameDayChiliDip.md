This dip is ALWAYS a fan favorite at every family party I have brought it too, or any party for that matter.  If you need a quick and hearty dip that only requires a few ingredients and only a few mins of prep time to whip up, this is your dip.

## Ingredients  
1 package of Cream Cheese(8 oz)  
1 can of Hormel Chili with beans(In my experience, it needs to be hormel)  
Cheddar or Mexican blend shredded cheese(probably 1/2 cup)  

## Directions  
1. Preheat the oven to 375.  
2. Layer the cream cheese, then the chili, then the shredded cheese in an oven safe dish.  Spread the cream cheese in an even layer on the bottom, then spread the chili over that.  Then top with shredded cheese, feel free to add/reduce cheese as needed.  
3. Bake for 10 mins or until the chili reaches the desired temprature.  Alternatively, microwave the dish until it reaches the desired temprature.
