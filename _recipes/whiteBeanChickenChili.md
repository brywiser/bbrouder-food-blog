One of my favorites growing up!  My dad would always make this on cold fall/winter days in Chicago.  Super easy, and super super quick, 30ish minutes start to finish.  Super flavorful and no added salt if you can believe it.  Feel free to double the beans or try two different types of white(ish) beans for a way to make it your own.  Also tastes good with canned peas or corn as well!  I highly reccomend topping with sour cream and any Mexican or Taco blend shredded cheese.
