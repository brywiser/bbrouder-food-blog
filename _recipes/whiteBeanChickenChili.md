One of my favorites growing up!  My dad would always make this on cold fall/winter days in Chicago.  Super easy, and super super quick, 30ish minutes start to finish.  Super flavorful and no added salt if you can believe it.  Feel free to double the beans or try two different types of white(ish) beans for a way to make it your own.  Also tastes good with canned peas or corn as well!  I highly reccomend topping with sour cream and any Mexican or Taco blend shredded cheese.

One of my favorite things about this recipe is while it requires a lot of ingridents, some of which are ones you might already have in your cabinet.  They are also easy ones to just keep in the cupboard for a rainy day.

## Directions

2. While the oil is heating, chop the onion and add it to the pot as you chop, stirring occasionally.   
3. Cut the chicken into bite size chunks and add them to pot, then add the garlic.  Stir the contents occasionally to prevent sticking.  
4. Rinse and drain both the beans, then add the chiles, cumin,  pepper, cayenne pepper to the pot.
5. Raise the heat to high, add the broth and the beans.  Cover and bring the chili to a boil.
6. While the chili is coming to a boil, mix the cornstratch in water. Then add to the chili until it reaches the desired thickness.

Enjoy!! Serve the chili with shredded cheese and sour cream if desired.
