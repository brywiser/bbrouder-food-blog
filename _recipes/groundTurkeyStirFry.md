You can find many variations of this all over the internet.  What I like about this one is that it is high in lean protein and relatively lower in calories, along with also using just a few ingredients that you likely have already in the house.  It is also pretty cost effective for a recipe to feed a family, or for meal prep.

When making this, go easy with the sesame oil, it can overpower the dish, it is also pretty high in calories. You can use any kind of veggies you want in this, I tend to stick with frozen Asian mix veggies(I'd avoid ones that already have sauce).  If you get ground turkey in a 12 oz package, feel free to reduce the amount of veggies to 1 bag.

1/2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil  
1/2 Tbsp brown sugar  
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)  
1 Tbsp water
### Stir Fry
1-2 bags frozen mixed veggies(Use 1 if using 12 oz Turkey)  
1-2 Tbsp Olive Oil
2 cloves garlic, minced  
19 ounces ground turkey  

## Directions  
1. Mix the stir fry sauce ingredients in a bowl and set aside.  
2. Heat the olive oil in a fry pan over medium heat, once its hot, add the ground turkey and the garlic.  Cook until the turkey is cooked and the water has dissolved in the pan(Roughly 8-10 minutes)  
3. After the turkey is cooked, add the frozen veggies and cook until well mixed and the veggies are soft.  
4. Once the veggies are cooked, add the stir fry sauce and mix well.  

Enjoy!  Serve by itself, or over Quiona/Rice.
