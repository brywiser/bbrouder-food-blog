For those who don't like brussel sprouts, try them this way. Super savory and delicious, who doesn't love bacon, am I right?? As like most my recipes, does not require a ton of ingredients and just takes 10 mins to toss together.  This recipe is more designed as an appetizer or as a side dish, however I have eaten this entire thing in one sitting by myself.  If you plan to serve it as an entree to more than 2 people, I would consider increasing the ingredients by 1 per 2 people.  

When I cut the bacon, I typically cut it into thin strips so it cooks quickly in the oven.  You can make them smaller or bigger if you'd like, but I personally like my bacon crispy.

Lay out the bacon and sprouts, add your oil and toppings, and spread it out on a cookie sheet so everything is in an even layer so it cooks evenly.
