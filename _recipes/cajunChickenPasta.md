Look now further for a pretty quick and easy weeknight dinner that everyone will love.  A friend of mine made this for us one day after golf and it was amazing.  Its super easy with not a ton of ingredients, for the cajun seasoning, I used Frank's Redhot seasoning.  You can use whatever cajun seasoning you have, or make your own from scratch!  Its also nice thats theres a gap to let the pasta cook, during that time you can clean up, or get side dishes ready.

1 lb boneless chicken(thighs or breasts), cut into 1-inch pieces

1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced  
2 cloves garlic, chopped(Adjust to taste)  
12 ounces pasta(Farfelle, Penne, Rotini works great)  
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth

## Directions  
1. Heat the oil in large wide pot(Make sure it's a large pot) over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and Cajun seasoning and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken just starts to change color and the spices are toasted, about 2 minutes.  
2. Add the peppers and onions and cook until they just begin to release some of their juices, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until softened, 1 minute.  
3. Add the pasta, chicken broth and tomatoes and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente and the sauce is thickened and reduced by about half, about 15 minutes(Longer wont hurt it).  
4. Remove from the heat and add the cream cheese and 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt. Stir until the cream cheese is combined and melted. The sauce may look runny, it will thicken as it cools.  
5. Top with sliced scallions.
