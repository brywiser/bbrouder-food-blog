This recipe was passed along to me by my awesome team lead. Its super simple, and super tasty! The curry that was reccomended to me, which I used was Vermont Curry by House Foods.  You can find it at Asian markets, I got mine off Amazon, under $4 and shipped with Prime.  This called for the Hot curry, which was not very spicy, and I am a whimp when it comes to spice.  Anyways, on with the recipe...  

This makes a decent amount of curry, if you are making it for 1 or 2 people, I would half the below recipe(I did the first time I made it).

## Ingredients
1 - 1.5 lb of Chicken(I used breasts, I imagine thighs would work too)  
1 Package of Vermont Curry  
1 Onion  
3 Carrots(Adjust to taste)  
3 Potatoes  
4 Cups Water  
2 Granny Smith Apples(optional, but very tasty)  

## Directions
1. Cube up the Chicken and Potatoes. Dice the carrots and onion.  
2. Add everything except the apples to the slow cooker and stir to combine.  
3. Cook on low for about 6 hours, or high for about 3.  
4. About 30 minutes before the cooking is done, cube up the apples and add them to the slow cooker.  

Enjoy!! The curry sauce should be about stew consistency, right between soup and stew, not to thick, not to thin.
