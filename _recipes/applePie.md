Use this filling recipe in conjunction with [my pie crust recipe]({% link _recipes/allButterCrust.md %}), or feel free to use canned pie mix.  I've used canned fried apples from Aldi when I have made apple pie before.  However, using fresh apples is always better than canned.

## Ingredients  
2 1/2 pounds (5 to 7) firm, tart apples, peeled, cored, and sliced ¼ inch thick  
2 1/2 pounds (5 to 7) firm sweet apples, peeled, cored, and sliced ¼ thick  
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar  
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar  
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh lemon zest  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  
1 egg, beaten lightly  

## Directions  
1. Toss the apples, 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar, brown sugar, zest, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.  Transfer the apples to a Dutch oven, cover, and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the apples are tender when poked with a fork but still hold their shape, 15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer the apples and their juice to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.  
2. Adjust your oven rack to the lowest position, place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet in the oven, and preheat to 425 degrees.  
3. Roll out a bottom crust for the pie and put it in the bottom of a pie plate, with about an inch of extra dough hanging over the edge.  
4. Drain the cooled apples thoroughly through a colander, reserving 1/4 cup of the juice.  Stir the lemon juice into the reserved 1/4 cup of apple juice.  
5. Spread the apples into the dough-lined pie plate, mounding them slightly in the middle, and drizzle with the lemon juice mixture.  Cover apples with rolled-out top crust, then trim, fold, and crimp the edges.  Cut 4 vent holes into the top.  Brush the crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the remaining one tablespoon sugar. I find it helps to brush the sugar around too.  
6. Place pie on the heated baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden, about 25 minutes.  Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees, rotate the baking sheet, and continue to bake until the juices are bubbling and the crust is deep golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes longer.  Let the pie cool on a wire rack until the filling has set, about 4 hours.
