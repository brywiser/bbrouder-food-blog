For those who have had my Banana Bread(Some have described it as amazing, but I dont like to make promisees), here is my recipe.  Its really straightforward, and a good recipe if you are just starting out into baking/cooking as it's a tough recipe to dry out.  You can also make it your own by adding nuts, chocolate chips, cinnamon top(which I explain below) to this recipe.  

You want the banana peel to be turning brown, do not use banana's where the peel is still green or mainly yellow.  The photo below is just past the minimum ripeness I would use to make the bread.

After you mix the ingredients, the mixture will still be thick, and there shouldn't be clumps of banana, but might look kinda chunky.

If you add the cinnanmon top, sprinkle it on top after you add the mixture to the loaf pan, not before.

## Ingredients  
### Banana Bread  
2 Cups All Purpose Flour  
1 Teaspoon Baking Soda  
1/4 Teaspoon Salt  
1/2 Cup Butter  
3/4 Cup Brown Sugar  
2 Eggs  
1.5 - 2 Overripe Bananas  

### Cinnanomon Topping(Optional)  
3 Tablespoons All Purpose Flour  
3 Tablespoons Sugar  
1/2 Teaspoon cinnamon
1 Tablespoon Butter cut in small pieces

## Directions  
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees(F), Grease or line a loaf pan with parchment paper(Tip: Spray the pan with water to get the parchment to stick, this way it keeps the paper out of the way until you add the filling.  Then requires no cleanup after since it's just water)  
2. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.  In a separate bowl, cream together the sugar and brown sugar.  
3. Add the banana's to the sugar bowl and mix to combine.  Then add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until combined.  
4. Pour the mixture into the loaf pan.  
5. *Optional:* If adding the topping, mix together the dry ingredients, excluding the butter.  Pinch pieces of butter into the mixture and stir until it looks like crumbly wet sand.  Sprinkle the topping evenly over the top of the banana mixture.
6. Bake for roughly 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  

Enjoy!!
